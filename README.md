In this repo we work on admissions dataset and learn about simpson's paradox 

Simpson's Paradox:

Simpson's paradox, or the Yuleâ€“Simpson effect, is a phenomenon in probability and statistics, in which a trend appears in several different groups of data but disappears or reverses when these groups are combined. It is sometimes given the descriptive title reversal paradox or amalgamation paradox.
